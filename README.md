# PointCloudMinim
I made this for my promposal, 2017! :)

To run the software, all you need is to have a properly configured OpenKinect library and Minim library, that's it! If you run into any performance issues, try upping the Processing RAM allocation. 

I used a bunch of basecode from Daniel Shiffman, and the Minim documentation. All rights, of course, go to them!
